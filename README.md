## Plug-In-support
If you have an issue to report, a bug to report or a new feature you would like to see, you can submit it on our [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Arcadier/Plug-In-support/issues). 

Before submitting an issue, we recommend that you skim through the previous reports first and see if there isn't anybody else who has filed the same report/feature request. This way, if the issue is fixed, and you have the same issue, you'll be able to follow the instructions our team has provided.

## Knowledge based questions
If you have a question about coding plug-ins, our architecture, APIs or questions which stat with "How do I do/create/delete....", then its strongly recommended you visit our [API Documentation](https://api.arcadier.com) or other repositories.
