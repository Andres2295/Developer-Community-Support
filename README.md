## Plug-In-support
If you have an issue to report, a bug to report or a new feature you would like to see, you can submit it on our [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Arcadier/Plug-In-support/issues). 

Before submitting an issue, we recommend that you skim through the previous reports first and see if there isn't anybody else who has filed the same report/feature request. This way, if the issue is fixed, and you have the same issue, you'll be able to follow the instructions nour team has provided.
